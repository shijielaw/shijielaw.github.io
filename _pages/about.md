I am a PhD student from [School of Software Engineering](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). My main research interest includes graph machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, uncerntainty quantification and optimization. During my master, my research focused on graph data mining, link prediction and group link prediction. My daily hobbies are swimming, playing basketball, fishing and reading with Ari Ma.
