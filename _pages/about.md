I'm a PhD student in Software Engineering from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). Now my main research interest includes knowledge graphs, large language models and link prediction. In master period, my research focused on graph data mining, graph neural networks and group link prediction.
